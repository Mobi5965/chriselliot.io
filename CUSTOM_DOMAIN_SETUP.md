# 🌐 Custom Domain Setup & Client Handoff Solution

## ✅ Problem Solved

Your Next.js + Plasmic project is now configured for:
1. **Custom domain deployment** (no more Plasmic subdomains)
2. **Independent client editing** (no local development required)
3. **Professional handoff** (complete client autonomy)

## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose Your Path)

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:vercel

# Add your custom domain in Vercel dashboard
# Update Plasmic host URL to: https://yourdomain.com/plasmic-host
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify
```bash
# Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
# Build command: npm run build
# Publish directory: .next

# Add custom domain in Netlify dashboard  
# Update Plasmic host URL to: https://yourdomain.com/plasmic-host
```

### Option 3: Any Other Hosting
```bash
# Build project
npm run build

# Upload .next folder to your hosting provider
# Configure custom domain
# Update Plasmic host URL to: https://yourdomain.com/plasmic-host
```
