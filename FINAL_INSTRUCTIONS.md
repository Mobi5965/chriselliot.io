# ✅ Final Setup Instructions for Plasmic Integration

Your Next.js project is now ready for Plasmic integration! Here's what I've set up for you:

## ✅ What's Been Completed

1. **✅ Plasmic Dependencies**: Already installed in your package.json
2. **✅ Plasmic Host Page**: Created at `app/plasmic-host/page.tsx`
3. **✅ Component Registration**: All your landing page components are registered
4. **✅ Project Structure**: Organized and ready for Plasmic
5. **✅ Documentation**: Complete setup guides created

## 🎯 Components Ready for Plasmic

Your landing page components are registered and ready to use:

- `HeroSection` - Hero with pricing and CTA
- `ProcessSection` - 9-step process breakdown
- `TestimonialsSection` - Client testimonials
- `Header` - Navigation
- `Footer` - Site footer
- `BookingModal` - Booking form
- `AboutModal` - About modal

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Create Plasmic Project
1. Go to [studio.plasmic.app](https://studio.plasmic.app)
2. Create a new blank project
3. Get your Project ID and Public API Token from project settings

### Step 3: Configure Code Components
1. In Plasmic project settings → "Code components" tab
2. Set Host URL to: `http://localhost:3000/plasmic-host`
3. Click "Refresh" to load your components

## 📝 Optional Configuration

If you want to use the full Plasmic loader features:

1. Update `plasmic-init.ts` with your real project credentials
2. You can use these components directly in new Plasmic projects

## 🎨 Using Your Components

1. **In Plasmic Studio**: Click "+" → "Code components" → Select your components
2. **Drag & Drop**: Add sections to build new landing pages
3. **Configure Props**: Event handlers and styling options are auto-detected
4. **Save Templates**: Create reusable templates from your designs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Components not showing?** → Verify dev server is running and host URL is correct
- **Props not working?** → Plasmic auto-detects props from your TypeScript interfaces
- **Styling broken?** → Tailwind classes and custom CSS are preserved

1. Use existing components as-is in new projects
2. Create variations and A/B test different designs
3. Let non-developers edit content through Plasmic
4. Build multiple landing pages from the same components
